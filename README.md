# CPU_Scheduling_Simulator

A C++ console-based simulator that implements core CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems, including both preemptive and non-preemptive variants. This project models realistic process scheduling, metrics computation, and algorithm analysis.

##  Algorithms Implemented

- **FCFS** – First Come First Serve
- **SJF** – Shortest Job First (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
- **Round Robin** – With configurable time quantum
- **Priority Scheduling** – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive

##  Features

- Time-driven simulation of process execution
- Real-time preemption and context switching
- Calculation of:
  - Turnaround time
  - Waiting time
  - Completion time
- Starvation scenarios and fairness evaluation
- Easily extendable for new algorithms
